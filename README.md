# Megaline customer behavior analysis
## Project background
Megaline is a telecommunications company that offers two prepaid plans to its users (Surf plan and Ultimate plan). The commercial department wanted to know which rates generate the most revenue in order to optimize the advertising budget. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates the most revenue.  The dataset includes information on customer demographics, location, chosen plan, as well as the number of calls made and text messages sent.

The analysis includes:
- Costumer behavior analysis: assessment of internet consumption, duration of calls and number of text messages sent by customers of each type of plan
- Revenue analysis: assessment of revenue generated by customer of each type of plan and over time
- Statistical analysis: evaluation of the differences in revenue generated by each prepaid plan using statistical tests

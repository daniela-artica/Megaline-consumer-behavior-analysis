# Megaline customer behavior analysis
## Project background
Megaline is a telecommunications company that offers two prepaid plans to its users (Surf plan and Ultimate plan). The commercial department wanted to know which rates generate the most revenue in order to optimize the advertising budget. 

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates the most revenue.  The dataset includes information on customer demographics, location, chosen plan, as well as the number of calls made and text messages sent.

The analysis includes:
- **Costumer behavior analysis**: assessment of internet consumption, duration of calls and number of text messages sent by customers of each type of plan
- **Revenue analysis**: assessment of revenue generated by customer of each type of plan and over time
- **Statistical analysis**: evaluation of the differences in revenue generated by each prepaid plan using statistical tests

## Used tools
- **Programming language**: Python
- **Development environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy(for statistical analysis)

## Key insights
**Customer behavior analysis**
-  Usersâ€™ call duration behavior does not significantly differ based on their plan choice. The distribution of monthly call durations per user is quite similar for both plans. The average call duration is 436 minutes for the Surf plan and 434 minutes for the Ultimate plan.
- In terms of messaging behavior, users on the Ultimate plan send more messages than users on the Surf Plan.
- In terms of internet consumption, users of both plans tend to consume a similar amount of gigabytes . However, Surf plan users tend to exceed their monthly internet allowance, with an average consumption of 16,717 MB meaning that they have to extra charges.
